# Expo Go: Module Not Found Error with Third-Party Library

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using Expo Go to test applications that rely on third-party libraries. The error typically manifests as a 'Module not found' error, often due to incompatibilities between the library and Expo Go's runtime environment.

**Problem:**
Expo Go has a limited set of native modules and dependencies. If a library depends on native modules or requires specific Node.js modules not included in Expo Go, it will result in a module not found error.

**Solution:**
The solution depends on the specific library.  Options include:

1. **Finding an Expo-compatible alternative:** Search for alternative libraries designed to work within the Expo ecosystem.
2. **Ejecting from Expo:**  Consider ejecting from Expo if compatibility with the library is crucial.  This grants more control but loses some of Expo's benefits.
3. **Using EAS Build:** Use EAS Build to build your app on a server, allowing for greater flexibility in library choices.  Note that this can be more complex to set up than Expo Go.

The example code included here showcases the error, and a proposed solution is provided for educational purposes.
