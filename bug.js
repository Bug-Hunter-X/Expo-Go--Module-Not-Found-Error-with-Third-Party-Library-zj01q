This error occurs when using the Expo Go app to test an app that uses a third-party library which is not compatible with Expo Go. The exact error message may vary depending on the library, but it usually includes a message indicating that the module is not found or cannot be resolved.  This is because Expo Go has its own runtime environment and doesn't support all Node.js modules that might be required by a library.

Example (using a hypothetical library 'uncommon-lib'):
```javascript
import { someFunction } from 'uncommon-lib';

someFunction();
```
This code would throw an error in Expo Go if 'uncommon-lib' is not compatible.
