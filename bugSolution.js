The best solution is to avoid using incompatible libraries altogether. Here's how to handle the issue:

1. **Check for Expo-compatible alternatives:**  Look for alternative libraries specifically mentioned as compatible with Expo. Libraries often list compatibility on their documentation pages.

2. **If no alternative exists:**
   * **Eject from Expo (Advanced):** This gives full control, but it makes you responsible for all build configurations. This is generally discouraged unless absolutely necessary.
   * **Use EAS Build (Recommended):** This will allow you to use the libraries without the limitations of Expo Go.  You'll need to set up an EAS Build workflow, which involves configuring the required dependencies and building the app in the cloud.  This is usually more complex but provides better compatibility.

Example showing how to modify the code using EAS Build:
```javascript
//No code change needed in the app itself, but the build process changes via EAS Build configuration
```

**EAS Build Configuration (example):** The details would depend on your project. This is a simplified representation.
```yaml
#eas.json
expo: 
  android: 
    package: 'your.app.package' 
    buildType: 'release' 
  ios:
    package: 'your.app.package'
    buildType: 'release'
dependencies:
  uncommon-lib: 'version'
build:
  type: 'build'
```
In the above example, we're explicitly defining the dependency on 'uncommon-lib' in the EAS configuration. EAS Build handles resolving and including this library during the build process.
